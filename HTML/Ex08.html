    <h1>Viewing Media files in HTML</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Media files in previous versions were supposed to be viewed using External plugins like Flash player and Silverlight. However after HTML5, we can now view the video files and hear the audio files. Currently few formats are only supported in the current version of HTML. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For Audio files: We use MP3 Format. and For video files we use mp4 Formats and ogg Formats.
